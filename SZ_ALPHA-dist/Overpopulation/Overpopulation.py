''' Overpopulation.py

A SOLUZION problem formulation of the wicked problem
"Overpopulation"

The main point of this formulation is to propose a
formulation and state-space for the current problem
of Human Overpopulation.

This formulation uses references from research obtained
from multiple sources, including a video, WorldBank
statistics, and a series of articles on the subject.

Overpopulation is the wicked problem that describes
the unsustainable growth of human populations across
Earth. This game aims to present a set of operators
that can be applied to help solve the problem of
Overpopulation.
