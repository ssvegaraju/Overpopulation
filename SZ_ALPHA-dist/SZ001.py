'''SZ001.py

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM:

This is a client-server problem-solving facility called SZ (for
"SOLUZION").  It loads a "problem formulation" file in the SOLUZION
format, which means Python code organized in a particular way.

ROLES:

A special feature of SZ is the ability to manage "roles" in
problem-solving sessions.  A role is some set of capabilities and a
view of the session intended for some particular user or group of
users.  For example, if the problem is to achieve a stabilization of
global warming, there may be a role for scientist who chooses among
financially viable interventions that should be applied, but there
could also be an adversarial role for a "denier" who tries to undercut
efforts to fund the programs required to solve the problem.

TECHNOLOGY:

This program is intented to be run in a Unix (e.g., Linux) environment.
It loads several Python modules including some that are not part of
the standard Python 3 distribution, and so they must be installed
separately:

flask
svgwrite
flask_socketio

This program (SZ001.py) was initially a variation of app.py (from below)
to which some SOLUZION-like elements were added.

The app.py  example comes from:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/easy-websockets-with-flask-and-gevent

This file SZ001.py (as well as the particular problem-formulation file
that is read in) constitute the SERVER part of a client-server system.
The client code is sent by the server, on request, to a browser that
request it.  The client code normally lives on the server in the "templates"
folder.  It's a Jinja template that is mostly HTML, which gets processed
into a complete HTML5 page when it is served.  Its filename is index.html.
That file includes a certain amount of Javascript, and it also loads in
some Javascript libraries, when run in the browser.  This Javascript
code allows it to carry out a long term "conversation" with the server,
never leaving the one web page that the file defines.  The communication
between client and server, begins as normal HTTP to load the page.
However, it immediately afterwards establishes a web-socket communication
channel, which has two advantages over the more common mode which is
Ajax interaction.  One advantage is low message overhead over the socket:
whereas an Ajax transaction has quite a bit of overhead, a socket message
has much less.  The second advantage is that the server can "push"
messages to one or more clients without the clients explicitly polling
for new messages from the server.  This simplifies the broadcast of
state updates in a multiuser context, when one user makes a change that
all other users in the same session need to see immediately.

To run this, cd into the subdirectory representing a problem formulation
such as RockPaperScissors.  Then type
../SZ001.py RockPaperScissors
Then point a browser at NICTO.CS.WASHINGTON.EDU:5000.

Or use a port number as an additional argument:
../SZ001.py RockPaperScissors 5432
